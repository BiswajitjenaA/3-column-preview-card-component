Kach Dost Ko Shayari

User
Mera ek friend ke pair me kach ghus gaya.... How to make a sayeri for him 

ChatGPT
Sure, here's a Shayari (poem) for your friend to lighten the situation:

"Zindagi ke safar mein chalte chalte,
Kadam thak gaye, raste ruk gaye.
Dost, aaj teri mushkil dekh kar,
Dil mein bhi dard sa ghus gaya.

Par khwabon ki udaan hai tere paas,
Hauslon se bhari ye aankhen hain.
Kach ke bhi pair tujhse na dare,
Himmat se mushkil ko tu paar kare.

Roshni hai andheron se ladne ki,
Dosti ka saath hai tujhko sahara.
Na darr, na ghabrana mere yaar,
Kach bhi tujhse jaldi durr hoga yeh sara.

Jab tak hai saath tere yaara,
Har mushkil asaan ho jayegi paraaye.
Dosti ki hai ye nishani sada,
Kach bhi kya cheez hai, tujhe to aasaan hai har raste par."

Translation:
"While walking on the journey of life,
Weary steps and halted paths.
Friend, today seeing your hardship,
Pain has even entered my heart.

But you have dreams to soar,
Your eyes filled with determination.
Even with a foreign object in your foot,
You will overcome every challenge with courage.

The light to fight the darkness is within you,
Friendship is your support and companion.
Fear not, worry not, my dear,
This thorn will soon be far away.

As long as I am with you, my friend,
Every difficulty will become effortless.
This is the eternal symbol of our friendship,
What is a thorn, to you, every path is conquerable."

Please note that this poem aims to provide encouragement and support to your friend in a light-hearted manner. Remember to also take care of your friend's actual physical condition and seek appropriate medical attention if needed.

Translation:
"A thorn has found its way in the path of friendship,
Causing pain in your friend's feet, hardship it has equipped.
Worry not, my friend, your friend is alright,
With you, their life's tale is forever alight.

Never let them fall, be their support,
Walk with them again, friendship's fort.
At every twist and turn of life, hold their hand,
Whenever they face sorrow, remind them, you'll always stand.

In your eyes, their dreams' gleam resides,
Amidst the clouds of pain, your touch abides.
Never leave them alone, be by their side,
Because you are their dearest friend, forever and worldwide."

I hope this heartfelt Shayari brings comfort and warmth to your friend during this challenging time. Let them know that you're there for them, and together, you'll overcome any obstacle that comes your way.

Kese hua kese hua ea haal tere kese hua like this

Kaise hua, kaise hua, ye haal tera kaise hua,
Dil ki baaton ko samajh na sake hum, kaise hua.

Khwabon mein khoya tha tu, aankhon mein basa tha tu,
Par kismat ki hawa ne badal diya saara jahan tera.

Dard bhari raahon mein chalte chalte, khud se begaane ho gaye,
Aitbaar tha tujhpe, magar tune thukra diya saara pyaar mera.

Kaise hua, kaise hua, ye haal tera kaise hua,
Dil ki baaton ko samajh na sake hum, kaise hua.

Tanhaayi ki raat mein khoya raha, tujhe yaad karte karte,
Kya kya khayalon mein khoya tha, ye koi jaane na sake.

Zindagi ke safar mein humsafar tha tu, magar ab kyun door hai tu,
Jaane anjaane raaston mein khada hoon, tujhe paane ki koshish mein.

Kaise hua, kaise hua, ye haal tera kaise hua,
Dil ki baaton ko samajh na sake hum, kaise hua.
